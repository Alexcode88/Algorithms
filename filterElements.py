# .filter()
# Write a function called filterElements. It receives 3 arguments: an array, a string, a value
# The string can have the following values:
#    - greater
#    - lesser
#    - equal
#    - notEqual
# You must filter all the elements that match with the criteria against the value and 
# return them in a new array
# For example:
# filterElements( arr, "lesser", 20)  arr = [10, 40, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Should return all values lesser than 20 inside the array  => [10]
# If no match is found return an empty array
